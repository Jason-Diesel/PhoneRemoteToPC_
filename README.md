# PhoneRemoteToPC
## Introduction
  <p>(OPS! this is a personal project for my own consumption, this is only for a learning experience and is not supposed to be seen as a commercial project)</p>
  <p>This project are two different application, "PCRemoteServer" as the server at the PC built with C++ and visual studio, and "AndroidUnityClient" which is for a android client built on Unity version 2023.2.20f1.</p>
  <p>This project allows you to connect your phone to your PC as a remote to execute bat scripts from the script folder, or code defined in PCRemoteServer/uh/Functions.h, while also having background images/videos. </p>
